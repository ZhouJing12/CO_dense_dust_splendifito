Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies

\subsection{ISM Basics} \label{ismintro}

The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex environment encompassing
a very wide range of properties (e.g., \citealt{1977ApJ...218..148M,
2005ARA&A..43..337C}).
%McKee and Ostriker 1977, Cox, 2005
In the Milky Way, about half the volume
is filled by a hot ionized medium (HIM) with $n < 0.01$ \cmv\ and $\tk >
\eten5$ K, and half is filled by
some combination of warm ionized medium (WIM) and warm neutral medium (WNM),
with $n \sim 0.1 - 1$ \cmv\ and $\tk$ of several thousand K
\citep{2005ARA&A..43..337C}.
The neutral gas is subject to a thermal instability that predicts
segregation into the warm neutral and cold neutral media (CNM),
the latter with $n > 10$ \cmv\ and $\tk < 100$ K
\citep{1969ApJ...155L.149F}.
%Field, Goldsmith, and Habing, 1969
The existence of the CNM is clearly revealed by emission in the hyperfine
transition of \hi, with median temperature about 70 K, determined by
comparison of emission to absorption spectra
\citep{2003ApJ...586.1067H}.
% Heiles and Troland Millenium Arecibo Survey
However, the strict segregation into cold and warm stable phases
is not supported by observations suggesting that
about 48\% of the WNM may lie in the thermally unstable phase
\citep{2003ApJ...586.1067H}.
% Heiles and Troland Millenium Arecibo Survey
Finally, the molecular clouds represent the coldest ($\tk \sim 10$ K
in the absence of star formation),
densest ($n > 30$ \cmv) part of the
ISM.  We focus on the cold ($\tk < 100$ K) phases here, as they are
the only plausible sites of star formation. The warmer phases
provide the raw material for the cold phases, perhaps through
``cold" flows from the intergalactic medium \citep{2006MNRAS.368....2D}.
% Dekel and Birnboim
In the language of this review, such flows would be ``warm."

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Star formation encompasses the origins of
stars and planetary systems, but it is also
a principal agent of galaxy formation and evolution, and
hence a subject at the roots of astrophysics on its largest
scales.

The past decade has witnessed an unprecedented
stream of new observational information on star formation
on all scales, thanks in no small part to
%the impact of
new facilities such as the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX),
the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Herschel Space Observatory,
the introduction of powerful new instruments on the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and a host of groundbased
optical, infrared, submillimeter, and radio telescopes.
These new observations are providing a detailed reconstruction
of the key evolutionary phases and physical processes
that lead to the formation of individual stars in
interstellar clouds, while at the same time extending the
reach of integrated measurements of star formation rates
(SFRs) to the most distant galaxies known.  The new data
have also stimulated a parallel renaissance in theoretical
investigation and numerical modelling of the star formation
process, on scales ranging from individual protostellar
and protoplanetary systems to the scales of molecular
clouds and star clusters, entire galaxies and ensembles
of galaxies, even to the first objects, which are thought
to have reionized the Universe and seeded today's stellar
populations and Hubble sequence of galaxies.

This immense expansion of the subject, both in terms of
the volume of results and the range of physical scales explored,
may help to explain one of its idiosyncracies, namely the
relative isolation between the community studying individual
star-forming regions and stars in the Milky Way (usually abbreviated
hereafter as \mw, but sometimes referred to as ``the Galaxy"), and the largely
extragalactic community that attempts to characterise the star formation
process on galactic and cosmological scales.  Some aspects
of this separation have been understandable.  The key
physical processes that determine how molecular clouds
contract and fragment into clumps and cores and finally
clusters and individual
stars can be probed up close only in the Galaxy, and much
of the progress in this subject has come from in-depth case
studies of individual star-forming regions.  Such detailed
observations have been impossible to obtain for even relatively
nearby galaxies.  Instead the extragalactic branch of the
subject has focused on the collective effects of star formation,
integrated over entire star-forming regions, or often
over entire galaxies.  It is this collective conversion of
baryons from interstellar gas to stars and the emergent
radiation and mechanical energy from the stellar populations that
is most relevant to the formation and evolution of galaxies.
As a result, much of our empirical knowledge of star
formation on these scales consists of scaling laws and
other parametric descriptions, in place of a rigorous,
physically-based characterization.  Improving our knowledge
of large-scale star formation and its attendant feedback
processes is essential to understanding the
birth and evolution of galaxies.

Over the past several years, it has become increasingly
clear that many of the key processes influencing star
formation on all of these scales lie at the interface
between the scales within individual molecular clouds
and those of galactic disks.
It is now clear that the large scale SFR is determined
by a hierarchy of physical processes spanning a
vast range of physical scales: the accretion of gas
onto disks from satellite objects and the intergalactic medium
(Mpc); the cooling of this gas to form a cool neutral phase (kpc);
the formation of molecular clouds ($\sim 10- 100$ pc);
the fragmentation and accretion of this molecular gas to form
progressively denser structures such as clumps ($\sim 1$ pc) and
cores ($\sim 0.1$ pc); and the subsequent
contraction of the cores to form stars (\rsun) and planets ($\sim$ AU).
% NJE put in scales re GB 2 comment; Rob should check
% NJE also left out "formation of bound clouds", not clear where it belongs
The first and last of these processes operate on
%in distinctly
galactic (or extragalactic) and local cloud scales,
respectively, but the others occur at the boundaries
between these scales, and the
coupling between processes is not yet well understood.
Indeed it is possible that different physical processes
%serve as
provide the ``critical path" to star formation in different
interstellar and galactic environments.  Whatever the
answer to these challenging questions, however, Nature
is strongly signalling that we need a unified approach to understanding
star formation, one which incorporates observational and
astrophysical constraints on star formation efficiencies,
mass functions, etc. from small-scale studies along
with a much deeper understanding of the processes that
trigger and regulate the formation of star-forming clouds
on galactic scales, which, in turn, set the boundary conditions for
star formation within clouds.

This review makes a modest attempt to present a consolidated
view of large-scale star formation, one which incorporates
our new understanding of the star formation within clouds
and the ensemble properties of star formation in our own
\mw\ into our more limited but broader understanding
of star formation in external galaxies.  As will become
clear, the subject itself is growing and transforming rapidly,
so our goal is to present a progress report in what remains
an exciting but relatively immature field.  Nevertheless
a number of factors make this a timely occasion for such a
review.  The advent of powerful multi-wavelength observations
has transformed this subject in fundamental ways since the
last large observational review of the galaxy-scale aspects
\citep{1998ARA&A..36..189K},
%Kennicutt 1998a ARAA
hereafter denoted K98.
Reviews have covered
various observational aspects of star formation within the \mw\
(\citealt{1999ARA&A..37..311E, 2007ARA&A..45..339B, 2007ARA&A..45..481Z}),
% Evans et al. , Bergin and Tafalla, Zinnecke and Yorke
but the most comprehensive reviews have been theoretically based
(\citealt{1987ARA&A..25...23S, 2007ARA&A..45..565M}).

We will take an observational perspective, with emphasis on
the interface between local and galactic scales.
We focus on nearby galaxies and the \mw, bringing in results from
more distant galaxies only as they bear on the issues under discussion.



================================================
heating mechanisms:
Y. Ao et al. 2013
The thermal state of molecular clouds in the Galactic center: evidence for non-photon-driven heating

What heats the dense gas to high temperatures in the GC?  The four most 
common mechanisms for heating the gas in molecular clouds are (a) photo-electric 
heating in photon-dominated regions (PDRs), (b) X-ray heating (XDRs), 
(c) cosmic-ray heating (CRDRs), and (d) turbulent heating. In star-forming 
regions, gas can be heated by electrons released from normal dust grains or polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Gas and dust are thermally coupled in very dense regions
($n_{\rm H_2}$$>$10$^5$\,cm$^{-3}$; e.g., Kr{\"u}gel \& Walmsley 1984).
However, the gas temperatures derived from H$_2$CO are much higher than the
fairly uniform dust temperatures of $\sim$ 14$-$20~K in the dense clouds of the GC
(Pierce-Price \etal\,2000; Garc{\'{\i}}a-Mar{\'{\i}}n et al. 2011; Molinari et
al. 2011). Photons can drive such decoupling only at the very surface of
irradiated clouds ($\sim$ a few percent of their total molecular gas mass; see
Bradford et al. 2003 and references therein). Only there might they have a
chance to dissociate complex molecules, such as H$_2$CO, which then necessarily
probe much deeper and UV-shielded gas regions where photo-electric heating of
the gas is no longer dominant.  Therefore, some other 
process(es) should exist that are efficient at directly heating the gas from outside.  X-ray
heating (Maloney \etal\,1996), cosmic-ray heating (G{\"u}sten \etal\,1981,
1985; Papadopoulos 2010), and turbulent heating (G{\"u}sten \etal\,1985; 
Schulz \etal\,2001; Pan \& Padoan 2009) are such potential heating mechanisms.

A few other heating processes also deserve to be mentioned. 
Gravitational heating (Goldsmith \& Langer 1978; Tielens 2005) is important 
during the collapse phase of molecular cloud cores. However, gravitational 
collapse is a temporary phase and star-forming activity, with the notable 
exception of Sgr\,B2 (not covered by our survey), is not vigorous in 
the clouds of the CMZ. Heating of the gas by magnetic ion-neutral slip 
(Scalo 1977; Goldsmith \& Langer 1978) would require further observations 
of the ionization fraction and the magnetic fields of the molecular clouds
(see, e.g., Ferri{\'e}re 2009; Croker et al. 2010), which is outside 
the scope of this paper. In a highly turbulent environment, the effect of a 
magnetic field on the cloud is to decrease the dissipation of kinetic 
energy, i.e., turbulent heating, and to lead to a lower gas kinetic temperature. 
Having already mentioned PDRs, we discuss in the following XDRs, CRDRs,
and the dissipation of turbulence.

\subsubsection{X-ray heating}\label{dis_xray}

In X-ray dominated regions (XDRs), X-rays photoionize atoms and molecules,
depositing a significant fraction of the primary and secondary electron energy
in heat (Maloney \etal\ 1996; Hollenbach \& Tielens 1999). Unlike UV photons,
hard X-ray photons are capable of deeply penetrating dense molecular
clouds and heating large amounts of gas. The X-ray heating rate is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
%\Gamma_{\rm X}=1.2\times10^{-18}\,C_{\alpha}\,(\frac{n}{10^5\,{\rm cm^{-3}}})\,(\frac{f_h}{0.3})\,
%(\frac{F_{\rm X}}{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}})\,(\frac{N}{10^{22}\,{\rm cm^{-2}}})^{0.9}
%{\rm erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}
\Gamma_{\rm X}=1.2\times10^{-19}\,(\frac{n}{10^5\,{\rm cm^{-3}}})\,
(\frac{F_{\rm X}}{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}) \nonumber\\ 
(\frac{N}{10^{22}\,{\rm cm^{-2}}})^{-0.9}\,
{\rm erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}
\end{eqnarray}
(Maloney et al. 1996), where $n$ is gas density in units of cm$^{-3}$, $F_{\rm
X}$ is X-ray flux density in units of ${\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, and $N$
the column density of hydrogen attenuating the X-ray flux. For the dense cores
studied here, $N$ is of the order of $10^{23}\,{\rm cm^{-2}}$. In the region
associated with the Galactic center and encompassing a diameter of about 20
arcminutes, the total X-ray luminosity in the range 2 to 40 KeV (Muno
\etal\,2004; Koyama \etal\,2007; Yuasa \etal\,2008; Dogiel \etal\,2010) is
6$\times$10$^{36}$ ${\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, yielding an X-ray flux density of
2.0$\times$10$^{-3}$ ${\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$.

The gas cooling via gas-dust interaction can be expressed as 
\begin{equation} 
\Lambda_{\rm g-d}\,\sim\,4\times10^{-33}\,n^2\,T_{\rm
kin}^{1/2}(T_{\rm kin}-T_{\rm d})\,{\rm erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}}
\end{equation}
(Tielens 2005), where $T_{\rm kin}$ is the gas kinetic temperature and $T_{\rm
d}$ dust temperature. For a gas density range of 10$^4$ to
10$^6$\,cm$^{-3}$, accounting for the velocity gradient,
${\rm d}v/{\rm d}r$, the line cooling is approximated well by the
expression
\begin{equation} 
\Lambda_{\rm gas}\,\sim\,6\times10^{-29}\,n^{1/2}\,T_{\rm kin}^3\,{\rm d}v/{\rm
d}r\,{\rm erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}} 
\end{equation}
(Goldsmith \& Langer 1978; Goldsmith 2001; Papadopoulos 2010), where ${\rm
d}v/{\rm d}r$ is the velocity gradient adopted to
calculate the line cooling rate in the LVG radiative transfer models. 
The line cooling is through rotational lines of CO, its isotopologues $^{13}$CO
and C$^{18}$O, and other species (Goldsmith 2001). If the water is highly
abundant in the warm clouds of the CMZ, the line cooling from the water
emission will be important, and this will lead to lower gas kinetic temperatures
in this section. However, this will not drastically change our results,
because water is unlikely to be that dominant. Furthermore, water vapor only
affects the cooling rate and not the heating process, so that our evaluation of
relative efficiencies of different heating processes is not seriously
affected.

If X-ray heating dominates the heating process, the gas kinetic temperature 
can be estimated from the thermal equilibrium
\begin{equation}
{\bar\Gamma_{\rm X}}=\Lambda_{\rm g-d}+\Lambda_{\rm gas}\,.
\end{equation}
To simply solve the equation above, we set the dust temperature to $T_{\rm d}$=0\,K,
yielding a minimum $T_{\rm kin}$ value and its simple analytic solution as below
\begin{eqnarray} 
T_{\rm kin}=(\frac{(16\times10^{-8}\,n^3+720\,n^{0.5}\,{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r\,
F_{\rm X}\,(N/10^{23})^{-0.9})^{0.5}}{12\,{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r}\nonumber\\
-\frac{4\times10^{-4}\,n^{1.5}}{12\,{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r})^{2/3}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Choosing a velocity gradient of 5\,\kms\,pc$^{-1}$, and adopting the observed
X-ray flux density of 2.0$\times$10$^{-3}$ ${\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, the
derived gas kinetic temperature is only 1\,K. It indicates that the observed X-ray
flux density cannot explain the high gas temperatures observed by formaldehyde.
Peculiar conditions in the CMZ, like a potentially high water vapor
abundance, enhancing cooling, or a high magnetic field inhibiting the dissipation
of turbulent motion, would not help to diminish the resulting discrepancy.

To simplify this: If the X-ray flux density were about 500 times higher than 
the observed value and line cooling dominates the cooling process, we could
derive an approximate gas temperature with
\begin{eqnarray}
T_{\rm kin}=45\,(\frac{n}{10^{4.5}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}})^{1/6}\,(\frac{{\rm d}v/{\rm
d}r}{5\,\kms\,{\rm pc}^{-1}})^{-1/3} \nonumber\\
(\frac{F_{\rm X}}{500\times2.0\times10^{-3}\,
{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}})^{1/3}\,(\frac{N}{10^{23}\,{\rm cm^{-2}}})^{-0.3}\,{\rm K}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
This equation shows that $T_{\rm kin}$ depends weakly on the gas density, velocity
gradient, column density of hydrogen attenuating the X-ray emission, and X-ray
flux density. The first three parameters cannot change significantly. If
X-rays really play an important role in heating the gas, an X-ray flux density,
about three orders of magnitude higher than observed, is required. Such an
intense X-ray radiation field may exist in some spatially confined regions.
However, it cannot explain the high gas temperatures on the large spatial
scales of the GC. Recent observations (e.g., Eckart et al. 2012; Nowak et
al. 2012) confirm that the X-ray emission from Sgr~A$^*$ shows flares, almost
daily, by factors of a few to ten times over the quiescent emission level, and
rarely even up to more than 100 times that level on time scales from a few
minutes to a few hours. However, this is still much less than what is required
to explain our observed kinetic gas temperatures.

\subsubsection{Cosmic-ray heating}\label{dis_cr}

For the UV-shielded and mostly subsonic dense gas cores (e.g., dark clouds),
cosmic-ray heating is the major heating process, and it may also play an
important role in heating the gas in the GC because the cosmic-ray flux density
is enhanced by the supernovae in this region. The cosmic-ray heating rate is
given by 
\begin{equation} 
\Gamma_{\rm CR}\,\sim\,3.2\times10^{-28}\,n\,(\frac{\zeta_{\rm
CR}}{10^{-17}\,s^{-1}})\,{\rm erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}} 
\end{equation} 
(Goldsmith \& Langer 1978), where $\zeta_{\rm CR}$ is the total
cosmic-ray ionization rate. If the gas heating in the GC is dominated by the
cosmic-ray heating, we can obtain the gas kinetic temperature from the energy
balance equation 
\begin{equation} 
\Gamma_{\rm CR}=\Lambda_{\rm g-d}+\Lambda_{\rm gas}\,.
\end{equation} 
As above in $\S$~\ref{dis_xray}, we set the dust temperature to $T_{\rm d}$=0\,K,
yielding a minimum $T_{\rm kin}$ value and the following analytic solution as below
\begin{eqnarray} 
T_{\rm kin}=(\frac{(16\times10^{-8}\,n^3+768\,n^{0.5}\,{\rm d}v/{\rm
d}r\,\frac{\zeta_{\rm CR}}{10^{-17}\,s^{-1}})^{0.5}}{12\,{\rm
d}v/{\rm d}r}\nonumber\\
-\frac{4\times10^{-4}\,n^{1.5}}{12\,{\rm
d}v/{\rm d}r})^{2/3}\,.
\end{eqnarray}

Similarly, we can obtain a simple solution as below if line cooling dominates
the cooling process
\begin{eqnarray} 
T_{\rm kin}=6\,(\frac{n}{10^{4.5}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}})^{1/6}\,(\frac{{\rm d}v/{\rm
d}r}{5\,\kms\,{\rm pc}^{-1}})^{-1/3} \nonumber\\(\frac{\zeta_{\rm CR}}{10^{-17}\,{\rm
s}^{-1}})^{1/3}\,{\rm K}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
If cosmic-rays are the only heating source, gas temperatures are constrained by
three parameters: gas density, velocity gradient, and the cosmic-ray ionization
rate. It is reasonable to adopt a gas density of 10$^{4.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ (still low
enough to yield (almost) optically thin H$_2$CO 3$_{03}\rightarrow2_{02}$
emission) and a velocity gradient of 5\,\kmspc\, for the clouds in the GC. The
poorly determined parameter is the comic-ray ionization rate. Using the assumed
parameters, the gas kinetic temperatures from Equation~(14) are 22, 54, 70, and
122\,K for cosmic-ray ionization rates of 10$^{-15}$, 10$^{-14}$,
2$\times$10$^{-14}$, and 10$^{-13}$\,s$^{-1}$. Thus, if cosmic rays play an
important role in heating the gas, a cosmic-ray ionization rate of at least
1$-$2$\times$10$^{-14}$\,s$^{-1}$ is required to explain the observed
temperatures in the GC, which is about three orders of magnitude higher than in
the solar neighborhood (e.g., Farquhar et al. 1994). Such an enhanced flux of
cosmic-ray electrons is inferred in Sgr\,B2 by Yusef-Zadeh \etal\,(2007), and
is interpreted as the main molecular-gas heating source in this region.
The required high cosmic ray flux of 1$-$2$\times$10$^{-14}$\,s$^{-1}$
would lead to an H{\sc i} density of about 500~cm$^{-3}$ (G{\"u}sten et al. 1981).
Such a large H{\sc i} abundance will cause noticeable 21 cm signals, which have
indeed been seen in H{\sc i} absorption surveys toward some GC clouds (e.g.,
Schwarz et al.  1977; Lang et al. 2010).  For comparison, Bradford \etal\,
(2003) estimate that a high supernova rate in the nucleus of NGC\,253 results
in a cosmic-ray ionization rate of 1.5$-$5.3$\times$10$^{-14}$\,s$^{-1}$.  This
mechanism may also play an important role in regulating the gas in
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) where the cosmic ray energy density
may be as high as 1000 times that of the local Galactic value or even
higher (Papadopoulos 2010; Papadopoulos \etal\,2011). 


\subsubsection{Turbulent heating}\label{dis_turb}
The dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy provides a potentially important
heating source in Galactic astrophysical environments, such as interstellar
clouds (e.g., Falgarone \& Puget 1995) and the warm ionized medium (e.g.,
Minter \& Balser 1997), and in extragalactic environments, such as
intracluster cooling flows (Dennis \& Chandran 2005).
The observed large velocity dispersion in the GC requires energy input to
support the turbulence because the dynamic timescale is rather short, around
10$^6$ years. This implies a high turbulent heating rate.  Following Pan \&
Padoan (2009), the turbulent heating rate is given by
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\rm turb}=n\,\mu\,m_{\rm H}\bar\epsilon\,,
\end{equation}
where $n$ and $m_{\rm H}$ are the number density and the mass of the hydrogen
atom, $\mu$ is the mean molecular weight, $\mu$=2.35 for molecular clouds, and
$\bar\epsilon$ is the average dissipation rate per unit mass.  The average
dissipation rate per unit mass, is given by
\begin{equation}
\bar\epsilon=0.5\,\sigma_{\rm v}^3/L\,,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\rm v}$ is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion and $L$
the size of the cloud. Replacing the expression for $\bar\epsilon$ in
equation~(16) and substituting units, the average turbulent heating rate is
\begin{equation} 
{\bar\Gamma_{\rm turb}}=3.3\times10^{-27}\,n\,\sigma_{\rm v}^3\,L^{-1}\,{\rm
erg~cm^{-3}~s^{-1}}\,,
\end{equation}
where the gas density $n$ is in units of cm$^{-3}$, the one-dimensional
velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm v}$ is in units of \kms, and the cloud size
$L$ is in units of pc. We can relate the one-dimensional velocity dispersion
and the observed FWHM line widths by the conversion $\sigma_{\rm v}$=$V_{\rm
FWHM}$/2.355 (Pan \& Padoan 2009). 

If turbulent heating dominates the heating process, the gas kinetic temperature
can be estimated from thermal equilibrium
\begin{equation}
{\bar\Gamma_{\rm turb}}=\Lambda_{\rm g-d}+\Lambda_{\rm gas}\,.
\end{equation}
To solve the equation above simply, we set the dust temperature to $T_{\rm d}$=0\,K,
yielding a minimum $T_{\rm kin}$ value and its simple analytic solution as
\begin{eqnarray} 
T_{\rm kin}=(\frac{(16\times10^{-8}\,n^3+7920\,n^{0.5}\,{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r\,\sigma_{\rm
v}^3\,L^{-1})^{0.5}}{12\,{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r}\nonumber\\
-\frac{4\times10^{-4}\,n^{1.5}}{12\,{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r})^{2/3}\,.
\end{eqnarray}\label{tkin_cal}
Choosing a velocity gradient of 5\,\kms\,pc$^{-1}$, an observed FWHM line
width of 20\kms, and a cloud size of 5\,pc, the derived gas kinetic temperature
ranges between 51 and 62\,K for a range in gas density of 10$^{4}$ to
10$^{5}$\,cm$^{-3}$.

For gas densities $n$\,$\leq$\,10$^{5}$\,cm$^{-3}$ and the assumed parameters as
above, line cooling dominates the cooling process and the solution can be
simplified to
\begin{eqnarray} 
T_{\rm kin}=62\,(\frac{n}{10^{4.5}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}})^{1/6}\,(\frac{L}{5\,{\rm
pc}}\,\frac{{\rm d}v/{\rm d}r}{5\,\kms\,{\rm pc}^{-1}})^{-1/3} \nonumber\\(\frac{V_{\rm
FWHM}}{20\,\kms})\,{\rm K}\,.
\end{eqnarray} 
This equation underestimates the gas temperature by less than 10\% in
comparison with Equation~(20), and shows that the temperature depends only weakly
on the gas density, cloud size, and velocity gradient, but strongly
depends on line width. Considering the line widths in different clouds, we
can use Equation~(20) to calculate the temperatures and present the results in
the last column of Table~\ref{table2}. To compare the calculated temperatures
by turbulent heating with the ones derived from the H$_2$CO measurements in
$\S$~\ref{dis_lvg}, we plot both temperatures in Fig.~\ref{tkin}. In general,
the temperatures agree within the uncertainties, supporting turbulent heating
as a good candidate to heat the gas to the high temperatures observed in the
GC. High gas kinetic temperatures were also deduced from NH$_3$ absorption
lines toward Sgr B2 by Wilson et al. (1982). They suggested that the high gas
temperatures were caused by turbulence maintained by shearing forces as a
consequence of galactic rotation.
 
For turbulent and cosmic-ray heating, we cannot distinguish which
mechanism dominates the heating of molecular clouds in the GC. 
With a large interferometer such as ALMA, one can try to search for molecular
clumps with thermal line widths, i.e. with line widths that are dominated by
thermal motion. If such objects can be found, turbulent heating can be excluded
because the narrow line widths cannot be explained by turbulent heating, and the
cosmic-ray heating will then be the dominant process to heat the gas to high
temperatures. Future observations of $x(e)\,=\,\frac{n_e}{2n_{H_2}}$ (the
average ionization fraction) can also help distinguish between these two
heating mechanisms, because high cosmic-ray energy densities will boost this fraction,
unlike turbulence (Papadopoulos 2010 and references therein). 

The special thermal state of the GC clouds may be the average state of the
molecular ISM in ULIRGs, with a direct impact on their stellar IMF
(Papadopoulos et al. 2011). The high temperatures of molecular clouds on
large scales in the GC region may be driven by turbulent energy dissipation and/or
cosmic-rays instead of photons. Such a non-photon-driven thermal state of the
molecular gas provides an excellent template for studying the intial conditions
and star formation for the galaxy-sized gas in ULIRGs.

A. Ginsburg et al. 2016
Dense gas in the Galactic central molecular zone is warm
and heated by turbulence?

The central region of our Galaxy, the central molecular zone (CMZ), is the
nearest location in which we can study star formation in an extreme
environment with pressure, turbulent Mach number, and gas temperature much
higher than in local star-forming regions \citep{Morris1996a}.  While there
have been great leaps in our understanding of star formation in local
molecular clouds in the past decade, there remain many unanswered questions
about how star formation changes as gas becomes denser, more opaque, and more
turbulent, as it most likely was in galaxies at the peak of cosmic star
formation \citep{Kruijssen2013a}.


The Galactic CMZ has attracted a great deal of attention recently because it
has a much higher ratio of dense gas mass to star formation tracers than the
rest of the galaxy
\citep{Longmore2013a,Longmore2012b,Longmore2013b,Kruijssen2014c,Yusef-Zadeh2009a,Immer2012a}.
The star formation rate in this region therefore appears to be suppressed
relative to the expectations from nearby star-forming regions and nearby galaxy
disks, where the star formation timescale decreases with increasing gas
surface density
\citep{Kennicutt1998a, Kennicutt2012a, Leroy2013a, Heiderman2010a}.  Within the
CMZ, the central $\sim100$ pc\footnote{Assuming the IAU-recommended $d=8.5$ kpc
\citep{Ghez2008a, Gillessen2009b, Reid2009a, Gillessen2013b}.} ``ring'' including
the  dust ridge \citep{Lis1991a, Sofue1995a, Molinari2011a} contains most of
the dense gas.  \citet{Longmore2013a} recently proposed that the clouds along
the ``ring'' \citep[which is more accurately described as a
stream;][]{Kruijssen2015a} represent a time-ordered path from starless to
star-forming clouds, from ``The Brick'' (G0.253+0.016, cloud a) through the
lettered dust ridge clouds \citep[clouds b,c,d,e,f][]{Lis1999a}, ending at Sgr
B2.  In principle, this would allow us to study the time evolution of
protocluster clumps given an orbital model to describe their motion
\citep{Kruijssen2015a}.

The thermal properties of this gas are a crucial component for understanding
the conditions governing both star formation and interstellar chemistry.  The
gas temperature sets the sound speed in the gas and therefore the Mach number
within a turbulent medium.  It also governs the thermal Jeans mass.  Regardless
of whether turbulence or gravity controls the fragmentation scale, the gas
temperature is clearly important.

Prior gas temperature measurements in the CMZ primarily used the popular
ammonia metastable inversion transition thermometer \citep[\ammonia (1,1) -
(7, 7);][]{Guesten1981a, Mauersberger1986a, Huettemeister1993a, Ott2014a},
which is
sensitive to moderate density gas \citep[$n(\hh) \sim 10^3-10^4$
\percc;][]{Shirley2015a}.  While this thermometer is generally reliable in cold
regions (e.g., the (1-1)/(2-2) ratio is accurate to $T_G\lesssim40$ K), the
population of the higher energy states \emph{may} be affected by formation
heating, a mechanism recently discovered to affect H$_3$O+ in the CMZ and
suggested to affect \ammonia, in which the excess energy from molecule
formation leaves a significant fraction of the molecules in a rotationally
excited state \citep[][]{Lis2014a}, so confirmation of the high temperatures
seen in \ammonia \citep{Mills2013a} can be used to assess the significance of
that mechanism.  \citet{Ao2013a} used the para-formaldehyde (\para) 218 GHz
thermometer \citep{Mangum1993a}, which is sensitive to denser ($n\sim10^4-10^5$
\percc) and hotter ($T_G>20$ K, usually $T_G\sim60$ K) gas, to map out the
inner $\sim75$ pc of the CMZ and found high temperatures comparable to those
found in previous studies.

There is a long-standing problem that the observed gas and dust temperatures do
not agree throughout the CMZ \citep{Guesten1981a, Molinari2011a, Ao2013a,
Clark2013a, Ott2014a}.  Photon-dominated region
(PDR) models predict that gas and dust temperatures should match at high column
densities
\citep{Hollenbach1999a}.  The observed discrepancy represents a significant
problem for understanding the importance of gas temperature and pressure in the
evolution of molecular clouds.  The dust temperature is readily estimated via
multiband continuum mapping and therefore is often used as a proxy for the
dense gas temperature.  While the discrepancy is not theoretically a problem,
as the gas and dust may remain collisionally uncoupled up to moderately high
densities given a high enough heating rate, it is an important empirical
difference between CMZ and Galactic disk clouds.  Dust and \ammonia derived
temperatures are usually assumed and often observed to agree in Galactic disk
clouds \citep{Pillai2006a, Dunham2010a, Juvela2012a, Battersby2014a},  but the
difference can no longer be ignored in the Galactic center.

Within both our own Galactic center and many nearby galactic nuclei, there is
controversy over which heating mechanisms dominate.  In the CMZ,
\citet{Ao2013a} were able to rule out X-ray heating as an energetically
important mechanism, leaving cosmic rays and turbulence (mechanical heating) as
viable candidates.  Studies of the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED)
around Sgr A* and Sgr B2 argued for mechanical heating and UV heating,
respectively \citep{Goicoechea2013a,Etxaluze2013a}.  Nearby infrared-luminous
galaxies have properties that resemble these regions
\citep{Kamenetzky2012a,Kamenetzky2014a}, but the debate about the dominant
heating mechanism remains open in many galaxies, allowing for photon-dominated,
X-ray-dominated, mechanical/turbulent, or cosmic ray heating
\citep{Loenen2008a, van-der-Werf2010a, Papadopoulos2011a, Meijerink2011a,
Bayet2011a, Mangum2013a, Papadopoulos2013a}.

We have expanded the \formaldehyde mapping project of \citet{Ao2013a} to a
$\sim5\times$ larger area, including the dust ridge and the positive-longitude
turbulent clouds thought to be associated with the intersection point between
the x1 and x2 orbits \citep{Rodriguez-Fernandez2006b, Riquelme2013a}.  We
describe the new
observations in Section \ref{sec:observations}.  In Section \ref{sec:signal},
we describe the analysis process used to extract signal from the data cubes.
In Section \ref{sec:analysis}, we describe how we
derive temperatures from the line ratios.
We discuss various implications of our data in Section
\ref{sec:discussion}.  In the appendices, we describe further details of the
data reduction process, include additional tables, and provide the source code
for all aspects of this project, from data reduction through figure generation
for the paper.
